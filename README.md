# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

This project allows users to utilize the concept of transfer and deep learning to choose a pre-trained neural network architecture, train a neural network classifier on a set of images and make predictions on new images.

- Developed code in Jupyter Notebook for an image classifier built with PyTorch
- Converted it into a command line application that takes user input
- Neural Network architectures available to the user are VGG16 and Alexnet

Disclaimer: This application only runs on GPU-enabled machines or while having access to cloud GPUs
